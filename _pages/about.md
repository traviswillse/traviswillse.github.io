I am a mathematician based at Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C. Previously I've lived in (been affiliated with) Portland (Lewis &amp; Clark College), Guanajuato (CIMAT), Vienna (University of Vienna), Warsaw (IMPAN), Canberra (Australian National University), Seattle (University of Washington; M.S., Ph.D.), and Eugene (University of Oregon; B.S.).

I research differential geometry, and my interests include conformal and projective differential geometry, geometric structures more generally (especially those corresponding to parabolic geometries), symmetries of geometric structures, invariant differential operators, special holonomy, and applications to holography and compactification.
