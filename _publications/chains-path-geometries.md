abstract: 'We derive the equations of chains for path geometries on surfaces by solving the equivalence problem of a related structure: sub-Riemannian geometry of signature $(1, 1)$ on a contact $3$-manifold. This approach is significantly simpler than the standard method of solving the full equivalence problem for path geometry. We then use these equations to give a characterization of projective path geometries in terms of their chains (the chains projected to the surface coincide with the paths) and study the chains of four examples of homogeneous path geometries. In one of these examples (horocycles in the hyperbolic planes) the projected chains are bicircular quartics.'
